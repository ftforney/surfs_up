## Purpose

We want to build a surf shop in Hawaii, but our investor is unsure of how well it will perform due to experiences in the past. Utilizing our skill sets, we set out to uncover data that could potentially get our investor fully back on board with the area we choose! Let's see the data we collected and if it will allow us to set up a surf shop in Hawaii!

## Results

Below are the June Temperature breakdown, and December Temperature breakdown.

 - The Maximum temperatures for June and December (in order) are 83F and 78F.
 - The Minimum temperatures for June and December (in order) are 71F and 60F.
 - The Average temperatures for June and December (in order) are ~77F and ~71F.

## Summary

It does seem to stay at a fairly okay average temperature during the Summer and Winter seasons, but it does appear to get somewhat cold for surfing in Hawaii at times during the winter season. This means the shop has a good potential to stay open all year round, but there will definitely be some weeks where there is less activity than usual!
